1. Assume that we have an iid. random sample \(x_1, \ldots , x_{1000}\) and weâ€™d like to use the normal Q-Q plot to assess whether the sample came from a normal distibution. How do you expect the normal Q-Q plot to roughly look like (i.e. what general features do you expect it to have and why), if the true distribution of the data is

    1. a normal distribution, 
    
    A straight line.
    
    1. a right-skew distribution,
    
    The left side of the plot would fall above the straight line.
    
    1. a left-skew distribution,
    
    The left side of the plot would fall below the straight line. 
    
    1. a bimodal distribution,
    
    The plot would have more turns as there would be more points where the "speed" at which the quantiles are gained change. Probably would look like an S
    
    
    1. adistribution with light tails,
    
    Straight line at the center. ends below the line at left and above at right
    
    1. adistribution with heavy tails?
    
    Straight line at the center, ends above the line at left and below at right

1. Recall the differences between the interpretations of the \(\chi^2\) homogeneity test and \(\chi^2\) test for independence. Come up with a practical situation where the collected data can be expressed as a 2-by-2 table and a related research question for which the correct interpretation is through
  
    1. the \(\chi^2\) homogeneity test,
    
    Test wheter different productionlines produce defects in the same distribution.
    
    1. the \(\chi^2\) test for independence.
    
    Test whether the color of a car is associated with the likelihood of getting into an accident.
