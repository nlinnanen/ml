You have to promise me that you will be more careful and polite. Can you do that?"" Anna and Ben say, ""Yes, we can do that, Mr. Lee. We promise. Thank you for giving us our ball back. And we are sorry for taking your flag. It is very beautiful."" Mr. Lee smiles a little. He says, ""You are welcome. And thank you for being honest. Honesty is a good thing. Maybe you are not so bad after all. Maybe we can be friends. But remember your promise. And now, go and play somewhere else. And be safe."" Anna and Ben say, ""OK, Mr. Lee. We will.

""Ben, Ben, grab the stick!"" she shouted. ""I'll pull you out!"" Ben heard Lily's voice. He was very cold and wet. He saw the stick, and grabbed it. Lily pulled him out of the pond. He was shivering and coughing. He dropped the hook, and hugged Lily. ""Thank you, Lily!"" he said. ""You saved me!"" ""I'm sorry, Ben!"" Lily said. ""I should have been more polite. I should have let you have the hook. It was your treasure."" Ben shook his head. He smiled at Lily. He said, ""No, Lily, you are my treasure. The hook was just a hook. It was not worth it. You are my best friend."" They hugged each other, and walked back to their ship. They decided to play pirates another day, when it was warmer and safer. They learned their lesson. They learned to be careful, and to share, and to be polite. They were happy. "

It can help you understand your emotions and communicate better."" She showed them how to touch the lamp gently and watch the colors change. She asked them to tell her how they felt and why.
